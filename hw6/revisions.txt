Homework 6: Matrix ADT

- Implemented opaque Matrix ADT using dynamic 2D float array
- Correctly initialized square matrices to identity, others to zero
- Implemented all operations: create, destroy, init, duplicate, equals, scalar_mult, mult, get/set cell/row, transpose
- Fixed mat_print to use "%8.3f" for exact 8-character fields
- All memory properly allocated and freed
- All tests pass with ./RUN
- No memory leaks (verified with valgrind)
